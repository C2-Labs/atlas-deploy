## Slack - Enterprise Feature
ATLAS currently provides a one-way integration with Slack. When a news feed item is created, the Slack integration will write updates from ATLAS to the channel of your choosing.  The update will include information about the event, the record that was updated, and a link back to the record in ATLAS.  This feature allows Enterprise customers to collaborate on ATLAS, get notifications, and script response actions within Teams based on customer preference and their business processes.
